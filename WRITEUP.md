# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app

I am going with App Service, as it is Cost-effective, no need for much scalability as it has less users. Workflow - the app is quite simple and doesn't require complex workflows so app service is more enough.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision

If we require to open this to multiple groups of users at a wider scale , also add more functionalities that would require maybe role level permissions , then a VM would be more applicable as it would give us the flexibility to customize and the cost would be justified.
